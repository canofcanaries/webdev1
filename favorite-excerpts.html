            <br>"Seizing in his arms the friend so long and ardently desired, Dantès almost carried him towards the window, in order to obtain a better view of his features by the aid of the imperfect light that struggled through the grating.<br><br>
            He was a man of small stature, with hair blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by age. He had a deep-set, penetrating eye, almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow, and a long (and still black) beard reaching down to his breast. His thin face, deeply furrowed by care, and the bold outline of his strongly marked features, betokened a man more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical strength. Large drops of perspiration were now standing on his brow, while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that one could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned.<br><br>
            The stranger might have numbered sixty or sixty-five years; but a certain briskness and appearance of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the course of time. He received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident pleasure, as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with one so warm and ardent. He thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome, although he must at that moment have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a means of regaining his liberty."

                I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;<br>
                Thou art too ugly to attend on me:<br>
                Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;<br>
                That holy shape becomes a devil best.<br>
                [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]<br><br>
                I see there's virtue in my heavenly words:<br>
                Who would not be proficient in this art?<br>
                How pliant is this Mephistophilis,<br>
                Full of obedience and humility!<br>
                Such is the force of magic and my spells:<br>
                No, Faustus, thou art conjuror laureat,<br>
                That canst command great Mephistophilis:<br>
                Quin regis Mephistophilis fratris imagine.<br><br>
                Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.<br><br>
                MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?<br><br>
                FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,<br>
                To do whatever Faustus shall command,<br>
                Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,<br>
                Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.<br><br>
                MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,<br>
                And may not follow thee without his leave:<br>
                No more than he commands must we perform.<br><br>
                FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?<br><br>
                MEPHIST. No, I came hither of mine own accord."
