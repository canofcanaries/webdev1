              <div class="poetry">
                <p>The birds are in their trees,<br>
                the toast is in the toaster,<br>
                and the poets are at their windows.
                <br><br>
                They are at their windows<br>
                in every section of the tangerine of earth-<br>
                the Chinese poets looking up at the moon,<br>
                the American poets gazing out<br>
                at the pink and blue ribbons of sunrise.
                <br><br>
                The clerks are at their desks,<br>
                the miners are down in their mines,<br>
                and the poets are looking out their windows<br>
                maybe with a cigarette, a cup of tea,<br>
                and maybe a flannel shirt or bathrobe is involved.
                <br><br>
                The proofreaders are playing the ping-pong<br>
                game of proofreading,<br>
                glancing back and forth from page to page,<br>
                the chefs are dicing celery and potatoes,<br>
                and the poets are at their windows<br>
                because it is their job for which<br>
                they are paid nothing every Friday afternoon.
                <br><br>
                Which window it hardly seems to matter<br>
                though many have a favorite,<br>
                for there is always something to see-<br>
                a bird grasping a thin branch,<br>
                the headlight of a taxi rounding a corner,<br>
                those two boys in wool caps angling across the street.
                <br><br>
                The fishermen bob in their boats,<br>
                the linemen climb their round poles,<br>
                the barbers wait by their mirrors and chairs,<br>
                and the poets continue to stare<br>
                at the cracked birdbath or a limb knocked down by the wind.
                <br><br>
                By now, it should go without saying<br>
                that what the oven is to the baker<br>
                and the berry-stained blouse to the dry cleaner,<br>
                so the window is to the poet.
                <br><br>
                Just think –<br>
                before the invention of the window,<br>
                the poets would have had to put on a jacket<br>
                and a winter hat to go outside<br>
                or remain indoors with only a wall to stare at.
                <br><br>
                And when I say a wall,<br>
                I do not mean a wall with striped wallpaper<br>
                and a sketch of a cow in a frame.
                <br><br>
                I mean a cold wall of fieldstones,<br>
                the wall of the medieval sonnet,<br>
                the original woman's heart of stone,<br>
                the stone caught in the throat of her poet-lover.

            <div class="title">A Tale by Louise Bogan</div>
            <div class="poetry">
              <p>This youth too long has heard the break <br>
              Of waters in a land of change.<br>
              He goes to see what suns can make<br>
              From soil more indurate and strange.
              <br><br>
              He cuts what holds his days together<br>
              And shuts him in, as lock on lock:<br>
              The arrowed vane announcing weather,<br>
              The tripping racket of a clock;
              <br><br>
              Seeking, I think, a light that waits<br>
              Still as a lamp upon a shelf, —<br>
              A land with hills like rocky gates<br>
              Where no sea leaps upon itself.
              <br><br>
              But he will find that nothing dares<br>
              To be enduring, save where, south<br>
              Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares<br>
              On beauty with a rusted mouth, —
              <br><br>
              Where something dreadful and another<br>
              Look quietly upon each other.
